# Abstract Algebra

Algebird is a library of data structures with interesting algebraic properties. Why is this important? If you can structure your application to rely on as little information as possible about the thing...

Here are the algebraic structures we support:

- [`Semigroup`](semigroup.html)
- [`Monoid`](monoid.html)
- [`Group`](group.html)
- [`Ring`](ring.html)
- [`Metric`](metric.html)

## Language

Comment on "is a monoid", "forms a monoid", "has a monoid" confusion.

## Syntax
